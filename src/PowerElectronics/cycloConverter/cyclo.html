          <p>In this type of triggering , a DC voltage of proper magnitude and polarity is applied between the gate and the cathode of the device in such a way that the gate becomes positive with respect to the cathode. When the applied voltage is sufficient to produce the required gate current , the device starts conducting. \n\tOne drawback of this scheme is that both the power and control circuit are DC and there is no isolation between the two another disadvantage of this process is that a continuous DC signal has to be applied, at the gate causing more gate power loss.</p>
          <p>AC source is most commonly used for the gate signal in all application of thyristor control adopted for AC applications. This scheme provides the proper isolation between the power and the control circuits. The firing angle control is obtained vary conveniently by changing the phase angle of the control signal.\n\tHowever, the gate drive is maintained for one half cycle after the device is turned ON, and a reverse voltage is applied between the gate and the cathode during the negative half cycle. The drawback of this scheme is that a separate transformer is required to step down the AC supply, which adds to the cost.</p>
          <p>In this method, as the name suggests, the energy is imparted by radiation. Thyristor is bombarded by energy particles such as neutrons or photons. With the help of this external energy, electron-hole pairs are generated in the device, thus increasing the number of charge carriers. This lead to instantaneous flow of current within the device and the triggering of the device. For radiation triggering to occur, the device must have high value of rate of change of voltage(dv/dt). Light activated silicon controlled rectifier (LASCR) and light activated silicon controlled switch (LASCS) are the exaples of this type of triggering.</p>

          <h4>Commutation are of two types: </h4>
          <p><b style="color: blue;">(A) Natural Commutation: </b>In case of AC circuits, as the current passes through natural zero, a reverse voltage is simultaneously appeared across the device. The device is immediately turned off. This process is called as Natural Commutation and no external circuit is required for this purpose.</p>
          <p><b style="color: blue;">(A) Forced Commutation: </b>In case of DC circuits, switching of thryistors, forward current should be forced to be zero by means of some external circuit. This process is called Forced Commutation and the ciruits which are used to turn off the thryistor are known as Commutation circuits.</p>
